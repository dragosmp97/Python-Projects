The projects were created using PyCharm.
For a quick presentation of the projects above, I recommend using a Python Online Compiler (for example: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

1. Copy the entire code from a specific project
2. Go ahead and open the compiler using this link in a new tab: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/
3. Delete everything that might appear in the left side of the compiler
4. Paste the copied code in the left side of the compiler
5. Press "Run"
